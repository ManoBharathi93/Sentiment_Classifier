# Template
- [ ] The pull request title should summarize your contribution.<br>
- [ ]  If your pull request addresses an issue, please mention the issue number in the pull
request description to make sure they are linked (and people viewing the issue know you
are working on it).<br>
- [ ] To indicate a work in progress please prefix the title with `[WIP]`. These are
useful to avoid duplicated work, and to differentiate it from PRs ready to be merged.<br>
- [ ]  Make sure existing tests pass.<br>
- [ ] If adding a new feature, also add tests for it.<br>
- [ ] All public methods must have informative docstrings.<br>
